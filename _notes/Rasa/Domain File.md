[[Responses]] - These are the things the assistant can say to users

Intents - There are categories of things user say

[[Slots]] - These are variables remembered over the course of a conversation.

[[Entities]] - There are pieces of information extracted from incoming text

Forms and Actions: These add application logic and extend what your assistant can do.

Responses:

```
responses:
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hey! How are you?"

  utter_cheer_up:
	- text: "Here is something to cheer you up:"
	  image: "https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg"
```

**Adding variation**

```
responses:
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hey! {name}. How are you?"
  - text: "Hey! {name}. How is your day going?"
```

Here when response triggered, randomly will pick the statement.{name} will be filed with value. other wise return 'none'.

**Responses: Buttons and Images**

```
responses:
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hey! How are you?"
    buttons:
    -title: "Great"
	 payload:"/mood_great"
	-title: "Super"
	 payload:"mood_super"
  utter_cheer_up
  -text:"Heris hte image"
   image:"image_url"
```

Responses: Channel specific responses

```
responses:
  utter_askgame:
  -text: "Which game would you like to play on slack?"
   channel:"Slack"
  -text: "Which game would you like to play?"
```

**Intents**
Intents are talks to the assistant, based the user's input classified by the NLU. To connect with proper intent.

```
intents:
 - affirm
 - deny
```

**What is "data" for a Rasa Project?**

1. The text data used to pretrain any models or features you're using(eg: Language models, word embeddings, etc)
2. User-generated text(Eg: Saying hello in multiple form)
3. Patterns of conversations(Eg: Customer support logs)

**How should conversations with your chatbot go?**
**1) Stories**
Training data to teach your assistant what it should do next.

1.  If you have conversational data start with the patterns.
2.  Generating your own conversational patterns:
    It's easiest to use interactive learning to create stories
    1.  Start with common flows, "happy paths"
    2.  Then add common errors/digressions
3.  Once your model is trained:
    Add more data from user conversations.

rasa_project/data/stories.yml

```
stories:
	-story: happy path
	 steps:
	 -intent: greet
	 -action: utter_greet
	 -intent: mood_great
	 -action: utter_happy
```

**OR Statments**

```
stories:
- story: newsletter signup with OR
 steps:
 -intent: signup_newsletter
 -action: utter_ask_confirm_signup
 -or
  -intent: affirm
  -intent: thanks
 -action: action_signup_newsletter
```

**Checkpoints**

```
stories:
- story: beginning of conversation
  steps:
  -intent: greet
  -action: utter_greet
  -intent: goodbye
  -action: utter_goodbye
  -checkpoint: ask_feedback
```

**We can start new stories from the check point**

```
- story: user provides feedback
  steps:
  - checkpoint: ask_feedback
  - action: utter_ask_feedback
  - intent: inform
  - action: utter_thank_you
  - action: utter_anything_else

- story: user doesn't have feedback
  steps:
  - checkpoint: ask_feedback
  - action: utter_ask_feedback
  - intent: deny
  - action: utter_no_problem
  - action: utter_anything_else

```

**2) Rules**
A way to describe short piece of conversation that always go the same way
rasa_project/data/rules.yml

```
rules:
	 - rule: Greeting Rule
	  steps:
	  -intent: greet
	  -action: utter_greet
```

3.  Intents
    rasa_project/data/nlu.yml

```
nlu:
	- intent: greet_smalltalk
	  examples:
	  - hi
	  - hello
```

- If we have data
- Modified content analysis:
  - Go through data by hand and assign each datapoint to a group
  - If no existing group fits, add a new one
  - At given intervals go through your groups and combine or separate them as needed
  - Start with 2-3 passes through your dataset
- If you don't have data
  - Start with most common intent
    - most people want to do the same thing
    - Use the experts in your institution
    - Start with the smallest possible number of intents
    - Everything else goes in an out of scope intent
      - If your assistant can't handle something, give users an escape hatch right away
- Why fewer intents?

  - Older style of conversational design - You need an intent for everything your user might want to do
  - Rasa style CDD - You only need to start with the most popular, important intents & a way to handle things outside them - Continue to build from there if that's what users need

  * Human reasons - More intents = more training data, maintenance, documentation - More intents = annotation more difficult

  - ML reasons - Transformer classifiers scale linearly with the # of classes - Entity extraction(Especially. with very lightweight rule-based system like Duckling) is often faster

  - Paring down intents

    - Don't use intents as a way to store infromation - Storing information = [[slots]]
    - Do a lot of same tokens show up in training data for two intents?
      - Consider if they can be combined

  - Training data for an intent

  * User-generated > Synthetic
  * Each utterance should unambiguosly match to a single intent - You can verify this using human sorting & inter-rather reliability

  - Is an utterance ambiguous? - Use end to end instead(the raw text as training data w/out classifying it) - ![image](/assets/Pasted%20image%2020230108214025.png) - ![image](/assets/Pasted%20image%2020230108214133.png)
