Augmented Reality - Connecting real object to digital object
 Marker Base Augmentation Reality
       Work based on marker, This reality works on the concept of tracking & recognition. 
 Marker Less Augmented Reality
       SLAM algorithm used in this reality. Detects the plane and we can place the object(Eg: Ikea Place) 
  Super Imposition AR
        This reality used for object detection, replaces the original image either partially or fully. (Eg: X-ray)
  Location Based AR
         Location based AR ties digital content and the experience it creates to a specific place. 
  Project Based AR
         Hologram projection, converts real objects to 3D objects. 
  Outlining AR
          It recognises the boundaries and lines(Eg: Maps) 


Virtual Reality - 
     It is the computer generated simulation of a three-dimensional image or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person.
Mixed Reality
     It combines AR & VR. It mixes real object with digital object.
